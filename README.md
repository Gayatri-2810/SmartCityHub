Problem Statement:
Citizens face delays and lack of visibility when reporting civic issues (potholes, streetlights, sanitation, water supply). Departments struggle with workload management and SLA tracking.

Solution:
A Salesforce-based portal where citizens can log issues, track them, and city departments can assign, monitor, and resolve them with SLA-based escalations, notifications, and analytics.
